# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I developed is used to track and store inventory of items. The requirements included the ability to log in, create a new account, display inventory items in a grid, increase and decrease item amounts, delete and add items to the inventory, and the option to receive SMS notifications when an item amount is low. The user needs this app was designed to address are a place to store a collection of items and a way to keep track of the amount of those items.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

This app needed to have a log in screen, a grid inventory display screen, an edit item screen, and an SMS notification screen. Some features included a menu, intuitive buttons and displays, the ability to create new users, and the option to opt in and out of SMS message notifications. These produced a user-centered UI for the app. I kept my design simple, easy to read, and easy to navigate. This kept the user experience in mind and ensured the design was successful for the users. 

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding my app by mapping out the main activities and breaking them up into seprate classes that all work together. This technique kept the code clean, easy to navigate, and easy to understand. Breaking the code up into separate classes ensures the code does not become cluttered and can be edited, scaled, and reused easily. I can apply this method in the future to other large coding projects.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my app in the Android Studio emulator. This process is important as it shows what the app will look like on a real device and how it will perform.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate in order to overcome challenges by modifying my design throughout the entire development process. It's important that you remain open-minded and adaptable throughout projects. You cannot stay ridgid, because once the roadblocks get in your way you won't be able to overcome them. 

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The most successful part of my mobile app was the design. Design is where my knowledge, skills, and experience shine through, and it is what I enjoy to do the most.
